List of things that need to be done as we move SPIFFE past a "super alpha" stage.

* [ ] Document all APIs in the proto files so that autogenerated documentation is useful.
* [ ] Separate out the various APIs based on role.  There should be:
  * Workload API -- this is the API that a workload uses to talk to SPIFFE and should be standardized across implementations. At a bare minimum it must support:
    * Listing the identities that are available to the workload.  `GET /spiffe/v1/identities`.  For each identity this should return a certificate and a private key.  One identity should be specified as "default".
    * Getting the root certificate bundle. `GET /spiffe/v1/trustedroots`
    * [optional] Support streaming updates for these
    * [optional] Support a certificate verification service where the workload can pass a certificate chain for validation. This concentrates validation logic into a trusted place.
  * Identity Control Plane API -- this is the API that other components use to coordinate to serve that API to the workload.  This doesn't need to be standardized as it may vary for different implementations of SPIFFE.  For this the reference implementation we'll need to be able to do the following:
    * Manage joining of node agents to the control plane.
    * Communicate (via streaming?) configuration information to the node agents. This includes the set of trusted roots and the map of which workloads (containers, processes, unix users) map to which identities.
    * Service CSRs from node agents on behalf of workloads.
    * Configuration of the identity control plane. This includes:
      * Assignment of identities to workloads across all nodes.  This is then passed down to the nodes.
      * Trusted roots
      * ACLs as to how this state is modified.
* [ ] Break out a k8s synchronizer that will populate the identity control plane as pods are assigned to nodes.  Over time we'll may want to get this more integrated into k8s so that pods delay start until the identity information has been distributed.  That k8s synchronizer will have to have permissions to read k8s and write (perhaps for a subset of identities and nodes) into the identity control plane.
* [ ] Consider: convert APIs to take DER encoded certificates instead of PEM. Protobuf can handle binary data directly and JSON serialization generally BASE64 encodes `[]byte` during seralization. The tools for driving SPIFFE can do the PEM->DER decoding.  Note: this is how the JOSE APIs work.
* [ ] Consider: Expose a server on a UNIX domain socket for admin access.  This avoids having to write the admin certs to disk.
